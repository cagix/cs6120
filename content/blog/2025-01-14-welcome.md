I'm incredibly excited to teach CS 6120, an experimental, open-source, hacking-oriented PhD-level course about compilers at Cornell!
We're using a broad definition of "compilers" that covers all aspects of language implementation.

We'll use this course blog for paper discussion and project reports throughout the semester.
