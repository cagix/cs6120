## Gist

* Welcome to CS 6120! I'm really excited for the semester.
* What is a compiler, and why should we care?
    * A simplistic answer is all about making programs go fast. And optimization is important, but compare Moore's law to Proebsting's law.
    * This class is about *language implementation* more broadly. What else goes into a good language implementation other than optimizations? (Not parsing.) Post your ideas in the [discussion topic][topic].
        * By the way, [lessons][] in 6120 have an associated discussion thread. We'll use these for just generally talking about stuff and also for reporting our results.
    * New languages + new hardware = lots of interesting problems.
        * Either one alone would be plenty to keep compiler engineers busy for a long time.
* Course overview and the [syllabus][].
    * Communication will be on [Zulip][]. [Sign up][zulip-signup] and stay on top of it!
    * Class sessions:
        * "Lesson" days.
            * I'll do some traditional "lecturing" in class, but that stuff is (mostly) mirrored by the videos attached to each lesson.
            * Most (but not all) lessons have associated tasks for you to complete.
        * "Discussion" days.
            * Everyone's job is to read the paper ahead of time and post a thoughtful comment.
            * Small-group and larger-group discussions.
            * The discussion leader's job is to write a blog post.
            * Remember to keep track of the [schedule][] so you know when to do these things!
            * The first discussion day is the next class, so plan to do the reading and submit a comment by 10pm on the day before.
    * The course project.
    * "Michelin star" grading.
    * Policies, academic integrity, generative AI, respect, accessibility.
* This lesson's task is about debugging the course structure.
    * Ask questions about the course setup in this lesson's [discussion topic][topic]!
    * Your first task is below: introduce yourself in the [introductions topic][intro] right now, and (offline) pick a paper discussion to lead.
        * This website and the [blog][], including the [GitHub repository][gh] where you'll send PRs. Work for 6120 is "real," open source, and for the world.
    * When you've done those things, submit the L1 marker assignment on [CMS][].

## Tasks

* Read the [syllabus][]! Seriously, please [actually read it][s].
* [Sign up for Zulip][zulip-signup] and introduce yourself in [the introductions topic][intro]. Mention a compilers topic you'd like to learn about someday, either in this class or beyond.
* Pick a paper from the [schedule][] whose discussion you want to lead.
  Claim it by opening a pull request that modifies [`content.toml`][cont-gh] to fill in your name on one of the `leader = "TK"` lines.
  (Feel free to ask questions about the papers on Zulip to help you decide!)
* Submit any text file you like to the L1 [CMS][] assignment to indicate that you've done the introduction and claimed a paper.
    * For this task, submit an empty text file or whatever.
    * For others, include a link to your code! I encourage (but don't require) you to do all your work as open source. If you don't want to open-source your solutions for some reason, you can upload your code instead.
