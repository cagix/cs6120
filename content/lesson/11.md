## Gist

* A [silly tweet][tweet] by [Steve Blackburn][steve], who is one of the world's preeminent GC researchers.
* The calamitous failure of manual memory management.
    * See, for example, this [finding from Microsoft that 70% of their CVEs are from memory safety bugs][ms-bugs].
    * The vast majority of languages today have either (a) manual memory management, or (b) automatic, dynamic memory management. Automatic, static memory management is mostly the domain of [Rust][].
* Some terminology:
    * *collector:* Short for *garbage collector*. The runtime system that calls `free` for you.
    * *mutator:* The actual program you're trying to run, whose garbage is being collected.
    * *live:* Will be accessed again in the future.
    * *dead:* Otherwise.
* Approaches to garbage collection.
    * Reference counting vs. mark/sweep a.k.a. tracing (sometimes just called "garbage collection" unto itself, but that's kind of confusing).
        * What metadata do they maintain, when do they run, what do they do, and what do they do when they run?
        * Reference cycles.
    * Refinements under the mark/sweep umbrella.
        * Conservative GC.
            * Its applicability to memory-unsafe languages like C/C++, where the compiler does not necessarily know which values are pointers.
            * A [cool blog post about Riptide][riptide], the GC in Apple's JavaScript compiler, that mentions that it uses a conservative GC. In fact, counterintuitively, lots of implementations of safe languages use conservative GCsâ€”try to think of reasons why this is the case!
            * The wasted memory seems bad, but ["Bounding Space Usage of Conservative Garbage Collectors"][boehm] by Hans-J. Boehm shows how data structures often don't have such a big problem.
            * A [thread on the Go mailing list][gothread] demonstrates why conservative GC often works much better on 64-bit than 32-bit architectures: because valid pointers are far more sparse in the space of all integers.
        * Parallel collectors use multithreaded tracing algorithms. (Useful but not *that* interesting.)
        * Some aspects of "when" the GC runs:
            * Concurrent collection: the mutator runs in parallel with the collector.
            * Incremental collection.
        * Moving/copying/compacting.
            * Semispace.
            * Generational.
                * The "generational hypothesis": pithily, that *most objects die young*. More usefully, when a given GC run occurs, recently-allocated objects are more likely to be unreachable than objects that have already lasted a long time.

## Tasks

* Implement a garbage collector for a Bril interpreter and the Bril [memory extension][mem], eliminating the need for the `free` instruction.
    * Most people will want to start with [the reference interpreter][brili], which is written in TypeScript. But if you like Rust a lot, you might consider modifying [brilirs][] instead.
    * Stick with something simple, like reference counting or a semispace collector. Because Bril lacks objects/structs, it's not really that meaningful to implement anything much fancier than that.
* Check that it works by running the [benchmarks][] that use memory after deleting all their `free` instructions.
    * First, check that the programs still work (and produce the same answers) when you delete `free`.
    * Second, add some tracking to your implementation to be sure that, when the program finishes, all the garbage that should be collected is collected. For example:
        * If you implement typical reference counting: After you finish returning from any function, the RC scheme should have freed anything that is only reachable from that stack frame (except for cycles). So when you return from `main`, *everything* should be freed (again, modulo cycles). You can check that this is true and print a warning about memory leaks if it's not.
        * If you implement a typical tracing scheme: You'll probably choose some heuristic to determine how often GC runs. Consider amending the heuristic to run one more time after `main` returns. After this final GC run, all the garbage should be collected. Consider printing an error at this point if there is a nonempty heap at this point.
